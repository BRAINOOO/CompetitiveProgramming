You think problem solving is about smartness , hardworking or experience ?
eg i can think in a problem 2 days this will affect my experience bec i can
solve  many problems in 2 days instead of only one problem and will affect 
my progress but it will improve my thinking in a good way so if i solve thousands
of problems i will have a good experience and it allows me to be high rated and 
a good problem solver but it doesnt mean that i am a good thinker i think thats
why we havent red rated coders in eygpt till now all top seniors are in nearly one
region bec above this region the problems may be completely out of the box doesnt depend
on our experience and we deal with a problem solving as a subject we must work hard
i think we must think hard instead of work hard.what is your opinion ?
